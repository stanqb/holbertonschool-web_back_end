# ES6 Classes

This project focuses on implementing and using ES6 Classes in JavaScript, exploring concepts like class construction, methods, inheritance, and metaprogramming.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you should be able to:
- Define a Class in JavaScript
- Add methods to a class
- Implement and use static methods
- Extend classes through inheritance
- Work with metaprogramming and symbols

## Requirements

- All files will be interpreted on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using Node.js 20.x and npm 9.x
- Code should use the `.js` extension
- Your code must pass all tests and lint checks
- All files should end with a new line

## Environment Setup

1. Install Node.js 20.x:
```bash
curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_20.x -o nodesource_setup.sh
sudo bash nodesource_setup.sh
sudo apt install nodejs -y
```

2. Install project dependencies:
```bash
npm install --save-dev jest babel-jest @babel/core @babel/preset-env eslint
```

The project consists of 10 tasks:
1. Create a basic classroom class
2. Initialize multiple classrooms
3. Implement a course with getters and setters
4. Create a currency class with methods
5. Build a pricing system with currency conversion
6. Implement an abstract building class
7. Create a sky high building with inheritance
8. Design an airport class with custom string representation
9. Implement a Holberton class with type conversion
10. Fix code hoisting issues
11. Create a car class with cloning capability

## Testing
